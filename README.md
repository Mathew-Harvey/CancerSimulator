This simulation visualizes Dr. Michael Levin's bioelectric framework: healthy cells (blue) communicate through bioelectric signals (▾) to maintain proper organization, while cancer cells (red) form a separate network with their own signals (■), promoting proliferation and disrupting tissue architecture. Click a cell to toggle its state.
